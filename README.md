# Halifax Regional Municipality - House Rental Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Halifax Regional Municipality - House Rental Analysis and Prediction project! This project was developed as part of a Data Analysis Hackathon, where our team focused on predicting future rental prices across Halifax, Dartmouth, Bedford, and surrounding areas.

## Project Overview

In response to the growing need for accessible and predictive rental pricing within the Halifax Regional Municipality, our team developed a comprehensive tool that leverages data scraping, machine learning, and web development to forecast rental prices. This tool aims to assist tenants, property managers, and real estate investors by providing an easy-to-use platform for accessing predicted rental rates based on various input parameters.

### Data Collection

Our data was meticulously gathered through web scraping from major rental listing websites such as Kijiji and rent444.com. This process involved extracting detailed listings that include prices, locations, amenities, and other relevant property details.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The scraped data underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and relevance. This step was crucial to prepare the data for effective model training and predictions.

### Model Training

We employed advanced machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and XGBoost, to develop our predictive models. These models were trained on historical data to forecast future rental prices with high accuracy.

### Visualization

To make our analysis accessible, we utilized Power BI to create dynamic visualizations of rental trends and predictions. These visualizations provide users with clear insights into the rental market dynamics in the Halifax area.

### Web Application

A key component of our project is the web application, which allows users to input desired property characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, location, and amenities. The application then displays the predicted rental price, making it a practical tool for anyone looking to rent or invest in properties.
